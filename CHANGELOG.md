# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `sim-doctor install [--agent claude|cursor|codex|opencode] [--print-only] [--dir DIR]` writes agent guidance:
  `.claude/skills/sim-doctor/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/rules/sim-doctor.mdc`, and a marked block in `AGENTS.md`
  that is replaced in place on re-run.
- Prebuilt binaries on tagged releases (macOS aarch64 and x86_64, Linux x86_64) and an `npx sim-doctor` launcher.
- Tagged-release publishing: the release workflow checks that the tag, `Cargo.toml` and `npm/package.json` agree,
  attaches binaries plus `.sha256` files to the GitHub release, then publishes to crates.io and npm (with provenance),
  skipping with a notice when a token is unset or the version already exists. crates.io package metadata added.
- The `npx` launcher verifies the downloaded binary's SHA-256 and has no-network tests (`npm test`).
- Illustrated logo (SIM card with a pulse line) as `docs/assets/logo-{light,dark}.svg` and `mark.svg`.
- README install section, CLI reference and logo; this changelog.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06

First tagged state of the M1 path: `sim-doctor scan` opens a PC/SC session, walks the card's file
system and reports it as a table or one JSON envelope. Structure-only: one rule runs (`gsma/msl-zero-allowed`,
behind `--tar`), so a score of 100 does not mean a clean card.

### Added

- Crate skeleton with documented module boundaries (#29).
- APDU codec, status-word handling and the session composition layer (#31).
- TLV stream decoder, caller-supplied FCP tag table and EF metadata (#32).
- The DF-tree filesystem walker (#33).
- SIGINT handling and process-level exit-status tests (#34).
- The clap CLI surface for `scan`: `--json`, `--dialect`, `--reader`, the walk bounds (#35).
- Finding and rule model with namespaced rule IDs (#36).
- `--severity` filtering, `--score`, and JSON purity guarantees (#37).
- TAR scanner and the MSL=0 rule `gsma/msl-zero-allowed` (#38).
- CI: fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, test (#27), and the swSIM + swicc-pcsc software-card fixture (#30).

### Changed

- Switched the license to MIT.
- Closed resolved dependency blockers in AGENTS.md (#28).
